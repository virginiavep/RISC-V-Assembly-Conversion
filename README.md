# RISC-V-Assembly-Conversion
C code and RISC-V Assembly conversion.
Starting with knowledge from https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars/wiki/Creating-Hello-World converting "Hello World" in C to assembly.
loop.c and riscvloop.asm files test simple looping behavior to demonstrate how high-level language programs are executed by a computer.
sum1-100.c and riscvsum1-100.asm accumulate the integer numbers from 1 to 100. 
riscvAverageOf100RandomInts.asm and averageOf100RandomInts.c calculate the average of 100 randomly generated integers stored in an array using the la instruction for RISC-V to load the memory address. 
riscv1DStencil100Ints.asm and 1Dstencil100Ints.c implement a 1-D stencil of 100 integers that are randomly generated using the array bracket operator to access the stored array elements.
